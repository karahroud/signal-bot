# signal-bot
I want to build a robot that will make a phone call and simultaneously send a message to Telegram on financial market charts after technical analysis and identifying important price action ranges or specific signals from some indicators. These charts may be dozens of charts and the robot and charts run on Windows. But the alarm can be received on the phone and Windows at the same time. I previously did a similar and incomplete work with Metatrader and mql4, but I am not sure it is beter idea .
For example, I think it is better to implement this project in Trading View
